        <h2>👋 Hi, I’m Ismail Mouyahada</h2>
        <p>👀 I’m interested in programming in a general way and more specifically passionate about algorithms, web, desktop, and mobile apps, IoT, and AI.</p>
        <p>🌱 I’m currently working on a new framework for web APIs in <strong>FreePascal</strong> language, I call it PascalREST (almost as fast as Golang 🧐🤣🎉, faster than Python anyway 🤓🎉).</p>
        <p>💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who shares the same mindset.</p>
        <p>📫 How to reach me? Just send me a pull request (just kidding), send me message on linkedin or create an issue on github (don't waste your time trying to phish, spoof me, you may get surprised ...etc) 😉</p>
