👋 Hello there! I'm Ismail Mouyahada, a passionate developer on a journey through the realms of code. My interests span the entire landscape of programming, from the intricacies of algorithms to crafting seamless web, desktop, and mobile applications. The fusion of technology in IoT and the endless possibilities of AI also fuel my curiosity.

🌱 Currently, my focus is on shaping a cutting-edge framework for web APIs using the powerful FreePascal language. I proudly call it PascalREST—it's not just fast, it's on par with Golang's speed (seriously, check it out 🧐🤣🎉), and it outpaces Python, no questions asked 🤓🎉.

💞️ I'm on the lookout for like-minded individuals ready to embark on collaborative coding adventures. If you share the same passion and mindset, let's create something remarkable together.

📫 You can reach out to me by dropping a message on LinkedIn or, for the brave, open an issue on GitHub. Pro tip: attempting to phish or spoof me might lead to surprises... you've been warned! 😉



🚀 Let's code the future together! 🚀
